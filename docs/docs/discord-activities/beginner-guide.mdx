# 🔰 Beginner Guide

This guide will help explain the basics of **[Discord Activities](/discord-activities/getting-started)**. We'll assume you're already familiar with web concepts like **[HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP)**, **[CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS)**, and **[JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript)**. Don't worry, you don't need to be an expert as long as you know the basics.

Before we get started, make sure you have **[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download)** installed alongside **[VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)** or your favorite code editor.

## Getting Started

We recommend using **[Create Robo](/cli/create-robo)** or **[RoboKit](/robokit)** to get started. Make sure your **[Discord Activity Credentials](/discord-activities/credentials)** are ready.

<Terminal create>{'<projectName>'}</Terminal>

This will help spawn a new **Robo.js** project as a **Discord Activity**. We call these **Robos**.

Once complete, you can run it in your **Terminal**.

<Terminal>npm run dev</Terminal>

:::tip

Make sure your **[Discord Activity Credentials](/discord-activities/credentials)** are ready.

## Core Concepts

Everything is in one place in **Robo.js**, making it easy to manage without proxying separate projects.

Unlike normal **Web Apps**, there's a few quirks to **Discord Activities**:

- **Authenticate with Discord**: Use Discord's **[Embedded App SDK](https://github.com/discord/embedded-app-sdk/)** to authenticate your users.
- **Follow Discord Proxy rules**: Discord has a **[Proxy](/discord-activities/proxy)** that you need to know about.
- **Tunnels are your friend**: You can't just use `localhost` in Discord, so we provide **[Tunnels](/discord-activities/tunnels)** to help.
- **Websockets for games**: If you're building a game, you'll want to use **[WebSockets](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSocket)**.

### Frontend Client

The frontend client is where you build the user interface for your Discord Activity. Even though you can use any UI library, we recommend **[React](https://react.dev)** for best compatibility with **[Robo Plugins](/plugins/directory)**.

You find the frontend code in the `/src/app` folder in our **[Starter Templates](/templates?filter=discord-activities)**.

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="js" label="Javascript">

```jsx title="src/app/Activity.jsx"
import { useDiscordSdk } from '../hooks/useDiscordSdk'

export const Activity = () => {
	const { authenticated, discordSdk } = useDiscordSdk()

	return (
		<div>
			<img src="/rocket.png" className="logo" alt="Discord" />
			<h1>Hello, World</h1>
		</div>
	)
}
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="ts" label="Typescript">

```tsx title="src/app/Activity.tsx"
import { useDiscordSdk } from '../hooks/useDiscordSdk'

export const Activity = () => {
	const { authenticated, discordSdk } = useDiscordSdk()

	return (
		<div>
			<img src="/rocket.png" className="logo" alt="Discord" />
			<h1>Hello, World</h1>
		</div>
	)
}
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Use Discord's **[Embedded App SDK](https://github.com/discord/embedded-app-sdk/)** to interact with Discord APIs.

You can structure frontend code however you like. Just make sure to exclude folders from the watcher in your **[Robo Config](/robojs/config#watcher)**.

:::info

Frontend code is handled by **[Vite](https://vite.dev)**, a fast build tool for modern web development.

### Backend Server

The backend server is where you handle stuff like **[Authentication](/authentication)** and custom features. You can use any backend library you like, but we recommend **[@robojs/server](/plugins/server)** for its simplicity and best compatibility with **Robo Plugins**.

You can create new **API Routes** in the `/src/api` folder named after the path you desire.

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="js" label="Javascript">

```javascript title="src/api/hello.js"
export default () => {
	return 'Hello, World!'
}
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="ts" label="Typescript">

```typescript title="src/api/hello.ts"
export default () => {
	return 'Hello, World!'
}
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Nest for subroutes, use async functions, return objects or **[RoboResponse](/ref/@robojs/server/Class.RoboResponse)**, read from **[RoboRequest](/ref/@robojs/server/Class.RoboRequest)**, and more.

</CardContainer>

### Tunneling

Discord doesn't allow `localhost` URLs, so you need to use a tunnel to expose your local server to the Internet. **Robo.js** helps you manage a free **[Cloudflare Tunnel](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-networks/)** to simplify this process.

When you run your **Robo**, you'll see a URL in the terminal. This is your tunnel URL.

![Discord Activity Dev](/img/discord-activity-dev.png)

Copy and paste this URL into your **[Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications)** as your root mapping and save changes.

## Authenticate your Users

To do anything with Discord, you need to authenticate your users. **Robo.js** makes this easy in your `App.tsx` file.

```tsx title="src/app/App.tsx"
import { DiscordContextProvider } from '../hooks/useDiscordSdk'
import { Activity } from './Activity'
import './App.css'

export default function App() {
	return (
		<DiscordContextProvider authenticate scope={['identify', 'guilds']}>
			<Activity />
		</DiscordContextProvider>
	)
}
```

This will prompt users to grant you access to their **[User Identity](https://discord.com/developers/docs/resources/user)** and **[Guilds](https://discord.com/developers/docs/resources/guild)**. Customize the scope to request more permissions.

```tsx title="src/hooks/Activity.tsx"
const { accessToken, session } = useDiscordSdk()
```

## Testing on Discord

Once you're ready to test your **Discord Activity**, you can run it in a **Discord Channel** or **Direct Message**.

![Discord Activity Launch](/img/discord-activity-launch.png)

You may need to download Discord's **[Public Test Build](https://discord.com/download)** or use **[Discord.com](https://discord.com)** to see console logs and debug your activity.
